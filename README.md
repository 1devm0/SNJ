### About
A game inspired by the Jujutsu Kaisen anime, based off of Gojo Satoru's character.
I've been working on this game for a few weeks on and off to create a more consolidated project in terms of the various games I've made and improve my portfolio. 

- Follow development on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/1dev_m0) 
- Right now I have a basic Pygame framework set up heavily inspired by DaFluffyPotato's game development framework.

### Dev Plan
